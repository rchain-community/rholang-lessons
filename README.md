## Running it locally

1. Ensure [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are installed.
2. Install dependencies by running `yarn` in the project directory
3. Run `yarn start` to start your local development server


## Deploying it

You can build a static version of this project using:

```
yarn build
```

This will result in a static build in the directory `dist`.

Previewing this static build can then be done through:

```
yarn serve
```
